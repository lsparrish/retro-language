them.

Compatibility Issues
====================

This release of Retro brings a number of changes that may require small
alterations to existing sources. Specifically:

  - maximum string length is now 256 cells by default
  - hidden functions are no longer revectorable

The first is not a big deal. It's now possible to alter both the maximum
string length and the number of temporary buffers. To restore a 512 cell
size as in 11.2:

::

  here 512 allot constant <512-TIB>
  [ <512-TIB> ] is tib
  [ 512 ] is STRING-LENGTH

The second change shouldn't be too critical. Basically it means that this
will no longer work:

::

  {{
    : foo  ( - ) 50 ;
  ---reveal---
    : bar1  foo foo + ;
    [ 100 ] is foo
  }}

Any private definitions are no longer revectorable. If you have no
**---reveal---** in a namespace, all functions are non-revectorable. This
won't break anything in the standard language or libraries, but could
be a problem if you rely on the old behavior in your code.
